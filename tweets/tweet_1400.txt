@TOCam29 @footthing @TcRacer @gopackjo @donstugots @CarlaFinch Having the flu and covid is very rare. People are not getting the flu because of covid. We cant say that masks and socially distancing are helping decrease the flu when it isnt doing that for covid. Getting the flu vaccine only mitigates the severity of the flu, not preventing it
