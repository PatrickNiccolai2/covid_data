@KatherineCowan @DanJohnsonNews Your not on your own cat üê± my mum age 84 hasn't had her 1st vaccination Covid19 jab yet. However I have heard them over 80,s that haven't had it will be getting the Oxford vaccine. I just hope the over 80,s get it in the next 2 weeks of this post because my mum is in vulnerable.
