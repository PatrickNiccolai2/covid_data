@ShirleyBurnham @IngramGlynis I'm in Tenerife they do things differently here.  It will be a while before I get my call as am 57.  No issues getting it when it eventually happens.  Only the Pfizer vaccine is officially licensed here so far being part of EU but a few of the other one have been administered.
