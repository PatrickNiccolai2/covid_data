@GoodMorningSac @FOX5Vegas It would be interesting to see what the outcome is. Here you can’t get the vaccine if you have tested positive or had a positive antibody test within 90 days. I’ve had my first dose, husband has had first dose, most of my coworkers are getting their second. No real issues.
